**üìù Answer Structure (STAR Method):**
```
Situation: Set the context
Task: Explain what needed to be done  
Action: Describe what you did
Result: Share the outcome
```

**Example Question & Answer (Multiple Industries):**

**üíª Tech Example:**
```
AI: "Tell me about a challenging project you worked on."

Your Answer: "In my previous role at StartupXYZ (Situation), 
I was tasked with rebuilding our checkout process because 
users were abandoning carts (Task). I implemented a 
step-by-step wizard using React and reduced the form 
fields by 40% (Action). This resulted in a 25% increase 
in conversion rates within two months (Result)."
```

**üìà Sales Example:**
```
AI: "Tell me about a time you lost a big deal and what you learned."

Your Answer: "Last year, I was working on a $200K software deal 
with a manufacturing company (Situation). I needed to close it 
by quarter-end to hit my targets (Task). However, I rushed the 
discovery process and didn't fully understand their integration 
needs (Action). We lost to a competitor who offered better 
technical support. I learned to invest more time in discovery 
and now always involve technical resources early (Result)."
```

**üè• Healthcare Example:**
```
AI: "Tell me about a time you had to advocate for a patient."

Your Answer: "I had an elderly patient who was experiencing 
increasing confusion, but the physician wanted to discharge 
him (Situation). I needed to ensure his safety while respecting 
the doctor's assessment (Task). I documented specific behavioral 
changes, consulted with the pharmacist about medication interactions, 
and presented my findings to the physician (Action). We discovered 
a drug interaction causing the confusion, adjusted his medications, 
and he improved significantly before discharge (Result)."
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

- Don't give one-word answers - elaborate with examples
